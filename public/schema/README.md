# Splits.io Exchange Format
The Splits.io Exchange Format is a JSON schema denoting a standard way of arranging run information for passing between
timers and other programs (like Splits.io).

The best way to digest the schema is the [**autogenerated documentation**][1].

You can also use the [**raw JSON schema**][2] for easy implementation, validation, or testing of the runs you generate
or consume.

## Examples
The schema is large, but many fields are optional -- a run at its heart resembles the following:

```json
{
  "_schemaVersion": "v1.0.1",
  "timer": {
    "shortname": "livesplit",
    "longname":  "LiveSplit",
    "version":   "v1.6.0"
  },
  "game":     {"longname": "Super Mario Odyssey"},
  "category": {"longname": "Any%"},
  "segments": [
    {
      "name":         "Cap",
      "endedAt":      {"realtimeMS": 143123},
      "bestDuration": {"realtimeMS": 141167}
    }
  ]
}
```

However you likely want to add some additional fields to contain previous attempts, skipped splits, and runner
information. For details around all possible fields, see the [documentation][1]. If you like, you can plug the raw
schema itself into your program for validation -- it's written in [json-schema][3], so any json-schema library will be
able to handle it.

## Changelog
We try to change the schema as little as possible. When we do, we post why here.

*Note*: All schemas accept any patch of an equivalent major-minor version, and any lesser minor version of an equivalent
major version (e.g. `v1.1.1` accepts `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, and `v1.1.2`, but not `v1.2.0` or `v2.0.0`). The exception is
schema `v1.0.0`, which only accepts `v1.0.0` runs.

- v1.0.1 (2019-07) Corrected a malformed `examples` key; updated some property names and descriptions; format now allows any future v1.0.x patch
- v1.0.0 (2018-09) Schema released
