  A speedrun data store, analysis engine, and racing platform.
</p>

## About

Splits.io is how speedrunners improve through data. It gives split-by-split
analysis of individual runs, viewed through a lens of all runs. On Splits.io,
speedrunners share more than their time—they share their entire history of
attempts, successful or not, and get feedback on how to improve long-term
through statistics and comparisons with themselves and other runners in their
weight class, both live (via races) and after-the-fact using historical data.

Splits.io works with LiveSplit and more than 15 other speedrunning timers. An
auto-generated list can be viewed in the [FAQ][faq]; new timers can
self-integrate using the [Splits.io Exchange Format][exchange].

## API
Client libraries exist for the following languages. These are created and maintained by community members:
- Python: [`jeremander/splitsio`][python-client]
- Rust: [`livesplit/splits-io-api`][rust-client]

For full API documentation and when using other languages, see the [API readme][api-docs].

[api-docs]: /docs/api.md
[python-client]: https://github.com/jeremander/splitsio
[rust-client]: https://github.com/LiveSplit/splits-io-api

## Local Development
Splits.io runs on Docker, which makes it easy and consistent to set up and run on any machine despite any unusual
dependencies. The one downside is that you must first install Docker!

### Requirements
* [Docker][docker-download]
* [Docker Compose][docker-compose-download] (on macOS and Windows, this is included in the Docker install)

[docker-download]: https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community
[docker-compose-download]: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

#### Special note for Windows
Because of how Splits.io uses Docker, Windows requires WSL2 to be installed to run Splits.io. If you haven't done
so already, follow these instructions when running Splits.io on Windows:

1. [Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
2. [Docker Desktop WSL 2 backend](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/)

These steps are not required for Linux or macOS.

### Running

#### First run
The first time you run Splits.io will take a while to build, so you should go grab a coffee or something:

```sh
make  # shorthand for make build run
```

Once the output looks settled (you should see `* Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:3000`),
open another terminal window and type
```sh
make seed
```
This is required, as it sets up a client ID/secret for your local JavaScript to communicate
with your local backend. It will also prepopulate your local database with some initial data.

After that, you're good to go!
Access [localhost:3000][localhost] in your browser.
The first page load after a new build may also take a minute.

_Note: If the page has no styling information on first run, try rebooting the server._


[localhost]: http://localhost:3000/

#### Subsequent runs
If you have already run `make` or `make build` in the past, you usually won't need to rebuild everything again,
so you can instead just run the faster version:

```sh
make run
```

If you do need to rebuild (e.g. when adding or upgrading a dependency) but don't necessarily want a server:

```sh
make build
```

#### Further Setup

These steps are not required for normal operation, but you may want to
perform them for specific categories of work.

##### OAuth

Some features are built on top of links with other platforms, like Twitch
sign-in. If you want these features to work, you need to register developer
applications with the appropriate services. Copy `.envrc.example` to `.envrc`
and follow the comments inside for details and instructions for various
platforms.

After following the instructions, run
```sh
source .envrc
make build run
```
to rebuild the server with your new environment variables. We recommend using
[direnv][direnv] to automate the first step whenever you change directories!

[direnv]: https://github.com/direnv/direnv

##### Emails
Splits.io sends emails when users go through the "I forgot my password" flow.
In development mode, these emails are not actually sent but are instead
generated then saved to `tmp/mails`.

If you want to preview a demo email in your browser, you can fiddle with the
previewers in `spec/mailers/previews` then access a URL like
```
http://localhost:3000/rails/mailers/:mailer/:action
```
such as
```
http://localhost:3000/rails/mailers/password_reset_token_mailer/create_email.
```

### Debugging
#### Getting Up and Running
If you're having trouble getting Splits.io running at all using the above instructions, please make a GitHub issue so
we can work it out! Even if you think it's a silly issue, the fact that it's happening to you means we haven't ironed
out everything (even if the only thing preventing you from setting up is better documentation!).

#### Working with the Code
If you have the app up and running but are looking for insight into debugging your own changes, you can access a Rails
console inside the Docker container with
```sh
make console
```

#### Attaching to a debugger
If you use `binding.pry` anywhere in the code, once you hit the breakpoint specified use the command
```sh
make attach
```
in another terminal window to attach to it.  To detach, make sure to exit the debug session then use the docker
attach escape sequence `ctrl + p` then `ctrl + q`.

If you need to attach to a container other than `web`, specify a container with the syntax
```sh
make attach container=worker
```

### Running Tests
To run tests from inside the Docker container, use
```sh
make test
```
To run only specific tests, use
```sh
make test path=spec/path/to/test/file/or/dir
```

### Linting
We use [Rubocop][rubocop] for code cleanliness and styling. To run it against changed files, commit your changes and run
```sh
make lint
```

### Profiling
Splits.io utilizes a few libraries for profiling our code.


[Rack Mini Profiler](https://github.com/MiniProfiler/rack-mini-profiler) is used to find major slowdowns in the code
through the use of the badge in the top left corner of the browser window. There is also a slew of different URL
parameters that you can use to get more detailed information about various aspects of the request. Details of these are
explained in the readme for RMP.
To get more detailed information about how code will perform in a production like environment, run
```sh
make profile
```
to boot the app in the profiling environment, which has most of the production flags toggled on.


[DerailedBenchmarks](https://github.com/schneems/derailed_benchmarks) is used to test memory over lots of requests.
The commands that can be run are detailed in the readme for DB. When you have a command you want to run, use the make
task like so with the options that you need
```sh
make derailed env="-e TEST_COUNT=5000 -e USE_AUTH=true" command="exec perf:mem_over_time"
```
The env flag is optional, so feel free to leave that blank if you have no environment variables to set.

[rubocop]: https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop

### Updating Gems or Docker
If you change the Dockerfile or Gemfile, you'll need to run
```sh
make build
```
to rebuild the Docker image for your changes to apply.

### Cleaning Up
If you want to reset from scratch, you can run
```sh
make clean
```
which will run `docker-compose down`, remove the bundler volume, and remove `node_modules/`.

## Things You Probably Don't Need to Know
### Infrastructure
Splits.io is built in Ruby on Rails, but has some help from other pieces of infrastructure.

Not pictured:

 - beta.splits.io, an AWS Application Load Balancer with an identical hierarchy
 except pegged at 1 instance, pointing to the same external infrastructure

 - livesplit-core, a Rust library with Ruby bindings that gets deployed to
 containers so Rails Web can call it to parse run files

 - AWS CodePipeline, which calls out to AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodeDeploy to
 build and deploy code on pushes to main
```
Rails will synchronously parse any unparsed run before rendering it, but the asynchronous Lambda job is the preferred
way for runs to be parsed because it still catches unvisited runs (e.g. in the case of a multi-file upload via
drag-and-drop).

In development PostgreSQL and S3 are also Docker containers (see [docker-compose.yml][docker-compose.yml]). Lambda is
not yet implemented in development mode.

[docker-compose.yml]: docker-compose.yml

### Favicons
Favicons are generated by [Favicon Generator][favicon-generator] and its Rails gem. To generate favicons from the source
image ([public/logo-imageonly.svg][logo]), run
```sh
docker compose run web rails generate favicon
```
Config for this generation is at [`config/favicon.json`][favicon-config].

[favicon-generator]: https://realfavicongenerator.net/
[logo]: app/assets/images/logo-imageonly.svg
[favicon-config]: config/favicon.json

### Theme
Splits.io runs vanilla [Bootstrap 4][bootstrap]. Historically we used one of a few themes to give it some additional
distinction and a professionally tailored dark mode, but we decided to switch to vanilla with our own dark mode after
several bad experiences with those themes slowly falling more and more out of date from mainline Bootstrap.

[bootstrap]: https://getbootstrap.com/
[dashboard]: https://themes.getbootstrap.com/product/dashboard/

## Responsible Disclosure
If you find a security vulnerability in Splits.io, please email it privately to security@splits.io, as posting the
vulnerability in public may allow malicious people to use it before it can be fixed. We take security matters very
seriously and respond quickly to disclosures.

## Library Information
### LiveSplit Core
Splits.io uses [livesplit-core][livesplit-core] for parsing runs. The parser is located in `lib/parser/*`. To upgrade
it, run
```sh
make update_lsc
```
and commit the changes.

[livesplit-core]: https://github.com/LiveSplit/livesplit-core/

### Highcharts
To generate run history charts Splits.io uses [Highcharts][highcharts-home], which requires a
[written license][highcharts-licenses]. Licensing is based on the honor system, so you do not need to enter a key
anywhere. Highcharts is free to use for testing purposes.
