        .panel-body
          p Thanks for being a patron! You get access to permalink redirectors, which are static links that will always
            redirect to your current PB for a given game and category. Here they are:
          table.table
            th Game
            th Category
            th Redirector
            - current_user.games.each do |game|
              - current_user.categories.where(game: game).each do |category|
                tr
                  td = game.name
                  td = category.name
                  td
                    a target='_blank' href=user_pb_path(current_user, game, category)

              code
                | /stats
              | and
              code

        p This will assemble your PBs into a Markdown table for use in a Twitch panel (or elsewhere). You should be able to
          copy+paste the output into a panel with no additional editing on your part.

      .panel-heading Splits Converter
      .panel-body
        p You can download uploaded splits in any exportable format we support, but if you need to convert splits and don't
          care about storing them, you can use this tool:
        p = link_to 'Convert splits to other timer formats', convert_path, class: 'btn btn-primary'
