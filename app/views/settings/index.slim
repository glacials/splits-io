						p If you like, you can permanently delete your account on Splits I/O. You can recreate it later by signing in with
							Twitch again, but it will be a fresh account with no runs.
						p You can choose to cascade this deletion to all your runs, or to disown them instead. Disowned runs do not belong to
							any user and will not be claimable, even if you recreate your account. Your name will not appear on them.
						p This is a hard delete. No one can restore your account if you change your mind.
