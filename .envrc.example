# This file is just an example.
#
# Some Splits.io features are built on top of links with other platforms, like Twitch
# sign-in. If you want these features to work, you need to register developer
# applications with the appropriate services. This file will walk you through that.
#
# First, run `cp .envrc.example .envrc` then re-open .envrc. Follow the instructions
# below for the services you want to set up. Then, `source .envrc` to apply its
# contents. You will need to reboot your local server afterwards.
# 
# To source .envrc automatically in the future, use direnv:
# https://github.com/direnv/direnv
#
# Every service is optional.
